I've been interested in programming since I was a kid, and first began coding in 2009 during my freshman year of high school. My high school did not offer any programming classes at the time, so I ended up exploring programming in my own time and learned how to code in C++ and C#. A few years later, I also began to learn a bit of Java, though I ended up focusing on C++ over the next few years.</p> <p>After graduating from high school in 2013, I focused heavily on game development and how to improve as a coder. Until starting at Bellevue College in 2017, I did not have any formal education in computer science. However, as a result of the time I spent refining my programming style and studying various aspects of software development during this time, I credit a large part of my present day coding style to the time I spent learning to write code on my own.</p> <p>As of 2023, I consider myself to be proficient in C++, C#, and Python. Over the years, I've used many other languages, including TypeScript, Ruby, Java, and many others. Although I have a strong preference to using C# whenever possible, I have found that I can pick up most languages and attain a reasonable level of proficiency relatively quickly. I actively use C++ and C# for my own projects, Python for miscellaneous scripts, and TypeScript for scripting demos on my blog.</p>"},{"location":"about-me/#education","title":"Education","text":""},{"location":"about-me/#bellevue-college-2017-2018","title":"Bellevue College (2017 - 2018)","text":"<p>I started at Bellevue College in 2017 with the goal of transferring to the University of Washington.

The original simulation was created to help me visualize the how the cache was being used as my transpose algorithm ran and allowed me to optimize the algorithm to reduce cache misses.</p> <p>In 2023, I rewrote the simulation in TypeScript and made it available as an interactive demo on my blog. Unlike the original simulator, this simulator performs an in-place matrix transpose, which allows the visualization to more easily fit on the blog layout that I use.</p> <p>After completing the demo for my blog, I decided to use the simulator as a testbed for experimenting with reinforcement learning.

I rely heavily on unit and integration tests to validate my code, and Unreal Engine's automation testing framework was significantly clunkier at the time than other testing frameworks such as GoogleTest. To fix this, I implemented my own testing framework that mimicked the design of GoogleTest, but generated tests that used Unreal Engine's automation testing framework under the hood. My testing framework also implemented a clone of GoogleMock, which was implemented entirely independently of GoogleMock but provided the same syntax for declaring and using mocks.</p> <p>This testing framework improved on Unreal Engine's automation testing framework significantly by making it possible to define tests using syntax almost identical to GoogleTest instead of the highly verbose test declarations that the Unreal Automation Testing Framework required. Additionally, I used the Boost C++ libraries' support for coroutines to allow unit tests to execute single method which could execute over multiple engine frames, which was a massive improvement over how Unreal Engine's Automation Testing Framework handled latent actions at the time. This testing framework was written prior to C++20, so using the coroutine support now built into C++ itself was not an option.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>While my testing framework was designed to match GoogleTest and GoogleMock as closely as possible, my testing framework was not created by taking the existing GoogleTest source code and making it compile for Unreal Engine.

The simulator supports a variety of different cache configurations and is designed to be used in a reinforcement learning loop to train agents of various types.</p> <p>Agents are scored by the number of cache hits they achieve while performing the matrix transpose. Each cache miss incurs a small penalty, and agents are heavily penalized if they overwrite a transposed value or write a value to the wrong location. At each step in the simulation, the agent may choose to read a value into a stack memory location or write a value from a stack memory location to the matrix. Agents may use up to 8 registers as temporary storage and no reward or penalty is given for register usage. Register usage does not impact cache usage.</p>"},{"location":"projects/matrix-cache-sim/overview/#high-level-architectural-overview","title":"High Level Architectural Overview","text":"<p>The simulation code is designed around a model-view-controller style architecture. The simulator classes fulfill the model role and are responsible for keeping track of the state of the simulator. As simulator state changes, the simulator emits events, which are captured by an event hub class that feeds events to the reward system and to the replay buffer. These classes are referred to as the observer classes and are responsible for providing feedback to the simulation algorithm and for recording the simulation so that it can be replayed later. Algorithm playback is handled by the simulation code on whattf.how, which is written in TypeScript.</p> <p>Lastly, the simulation code contains a set of interfaces that are implemented by each agent that the simulation code supports. These agents range from classical algorithms to reinforcement learning agents.

Instead, methods on the observer classes will be attached to events implemented by the simulator interface. This ensures that the observer classes remain entirely decoupled from the simulation code.</p> <p>In order to facilitate both simulation playback as well as agent training, the simulator will emit three types of events. The first type of event is emitted when a memory location is accessed by the agent. The second and third types of events are emitted when a cache hit or miss occurs, respectively. Cache hits and misses are treated as separate events to make it easier for observer classes to track the state of the cache.</p>"},{"location":"projects/matrix-cache-sim/overview/#observer-architecture","title":"Observer Architecture","text":"<p>The observer classes consist of a main event hub that receives all events from the simulator and a set of listeners that attach to event hub events.
