# About Me
## Who Am I?
My name is Zach Wilson. I've been interested in programming since I was a kid,
and first began coding in 2009 during my freshman year of high school. My high
school did not offer any programming classes at the time, so I ended up
exploring programming in my own time and learned how to code in C++ and C#. A
few years later, I also began to learn a bit of Java, though I ended up focusing
on C++ over the next few years.

After graduating from high school in 2013, I focused heavily on game development
and how to improve as a coder. Until starting at Bellevue College in 2017, I
did not have any formal education in computer science. However, as a result of
the time I spent refining my programming style and studying various aspects of
software development during this time, I credit a large part of my present day
coding style to the time I spent learning to write code on my own.

As of 2023, I consider myself to be proficient in C++, C#, and Python. Over the
years, I've used many other languages, including TypeScript, Ruby, Java, and
many others. Although I have a strong preference to using C# whenever possible,
I have found that I can pick up most languages and attain a reasonable level of
proficiency relatively quickly. I actively use C++ and C# for my own projects,
Python for miscellaneous scripts, and TypeScript for scripting demos on my blog.

## Education
### Bellevue College (2017 - 2018)
I started at Bellevue College in 2017 with the goal of transferring to the
University of Washington. I spent 5 quarters at Bellevue College starting in
Spring 2017 and ending in Spring 2018, including a single-class quarter during
Summer 2017. I transferred out of Bellevue College with a 4.0GPA.

### University of Washington, Seattle (2018 - 2020)
I was accepted into the University of Washington (Seattle)'s CSE program and
began taking classes in Autumn 2018. I completed my bachelor's degree after
Autumn quarter 2020 with a 3.8GPA.

## Career
### Nvidia (2019 - Present)
I interned at Nvidia during summer 2019 and summer 2020 before starting full
time immediately after graduating from UW. Both internships and my full time
position were with the team responsible for Nvidia's low latency video streaming
SDK that powers Nvidia products such as GeForce Now and Omniverse. As part of
this team, I have been responsible for video related work as well as build
related work.
