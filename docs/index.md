# Research Projects and Demos
Hello there! Welcome to `wizard.dev`, my portfolio of projects I've worked on.
Many of these projects were created with the goal of experimenting with and
learning more about machine learning and robotics, two fields that I'm deeply
interested in learning more about. You can find the source code for each of the
projects on this site's [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/zkWildfire/wizard.dev)
and interactive demos of these projects on my blog at [whattf.how](https://www.whattf.how).
You can also learn more about who I am on the [About Me](./about-me.md) page.
