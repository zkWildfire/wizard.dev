## Overview
This section of pages contains all my notes on academic subjects I've studied as
well as various frameworks, libraries, and other tools that I've used. My goal
for these pages is for them to provide detailed information about the various
topics as well as to act as quick references for experienced developers who need
to quickly check how to do a specific task. These pages are primarily intended
for my personal use but should hopefully prove useful to others as well.

## Academic Subjects
### Discrete Mathematics
This category consists of the notes I've taken while studying discrete
mathematics during the UW CSE311: Foundations of Computing I course.

### Linear Algebra


### Probability and Statistics


### Japanese
This section contains the notes I've created while studying Japanese via
Duolingo. Notes are sorted by the Duolingo unit that they correspond to.

Note that I began creating these notes after reaching section 2 unit 11, so
the pages for previous units may not be complete as many of them were created
by pulling material from each unit's guidebook. Since the guidebook does not
list all the vocabulary and kanji that are taught in each unit, the notes for
those units may be missing some information.
