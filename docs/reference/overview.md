## Overview
This section of pages contains all my notes on academic subjects I've studied as
well as various frameworks, libraries, and other tools that I've used. My goal
for these pages is for them to provide detailed information about the various
topics as well as to act as quick references for experienced developers who need
to quickly check how to do a specific task. These pages are primarily intended
for my personal use but should hopefully prove useful to others as well.

## Academic Subjects
### Discrete Mathematics
This category consists of the notes I've taken while studying discrete
mathematics during the UW CSE311: Foundations of Computing I course.

### Linear Algebra


### Probability and Statistics


### Japanese
This section contains the notes I've created while studying Japanese via
Duolingo. Notes are sorted by the Duolingo unit that they correspond to.

!!! warning
    I began creating these notes after reaching section 2 unit 11, so the pages
    for previous units may not be complete. This is because I created the pages
    for the earlier units by using the guidebook for the unit, which does not
    cover all the vocabulary and kanji that are taught in the unit. For units
    after I started creating these notes, the notes were updated any time new
    vocabulary or kanji were introduced within the unit, so the notes for those
    units should be complete.
