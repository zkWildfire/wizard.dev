# Grammar
## Overview
This page is designed to be a quick reference for various grammatical rules.
The primary source for the information on this page is the book "A Guide to
Japanese Grammar" by Tae Kim; however, the book is not the only source that
this material is derived from. Note that since this page is meant to be a
quick reference rather than a comprehensive guide, its intended audience are
learners who already have a basic understanding of Japanese grammar. This page
should not be relied upon as a primary source of information for learning
Japanese grammar.

## Nouns
### Expressing State of Being
Sentences expressing state of being come in the form of "A is B" or "A is not
B". For example, "学生です" means "I am a student", and "学生じゃないです" means
"I am not a student". The following table shows the conjugation rules for
expressing state of being:

|          | Positive | Negative |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Non-Past | だ (optional) | じゃない  |
| Past     | だった   | じゃなかった |

Using だ typically makes the sentence more emphatic and forceful, so it's not
always used. However, the rules around the usage of だ are a bit more complex
than that as there are times where it must be used and times where it cannot
be used.

## Particles
### Topic Particle: は
は is used to mark the topic of a sentence. However, once the topic has been
established, both the topic and the は particle can be omitted from the rest
of the conversation as long as the topic is clear from context.

### Inclusive Topic Particle: も
The も particle is referred to as the "inclusive topic particle" by Tae Kim
because it's used in a similar way to the English word "also". The particle
allows a speaker to add additional information when replying to a question.
However, when using the particle, it's important that the "direction" of the
sentence, positive or negative, remains the same.

For example, assume someone is asked the question アリスは学生？ (Is Alice a
student?). The response うん、トムも学生. (Yes, and Tom is also a student) is a
correct usage of the も particle because the sentence is joining the positive
statement "Alice is a student" with the positive statement "Tom is a student".
However, the response うん、トムも学生じゃない (Yes, and Tom is also not a
student) is incorrect because the sentence is joining the positive statement
"Alice is a student" with the negative statement "Tom is not a student".

### Identifier Particle: が
The が particle must be used in place of the は particle when the topic of
the sentence is a noun that is being identified. For example, if one wanted
to ask "Who is a student?", the proper way to ask the question would be
誰が学生？ rather than 誰は学生？. 誰 is a placeholder for the person being
identified, so the identifier particle が must be used instead of the topic
particle は.

Also, when replying to a question that used the identifier particle が, the
response must also use the identifier particle が. Continuing with the previous
example of 誰が学生？, the proper response would be トムが学生 rather than
トムは学生. In comparison, replying with トムは学生 would be more like saying
"Tom is *a* student, but maybe not *the* student you're asking about".

## Adjectives
### な-Adjectives
The conjugation rules for な-adjectives are the same as those for nouns:

|          | Positive | Negative |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Non-Past | だ       | じゃない  |
| Past     | だった   | じゃなかった |

When using a な-adjective with a noun, な must be inserted between the
adjective and the noun. For example, given the adjective 静か (quiet), the
proper way to say "a quiet person" is 静かな人, not 静か人. This is why these
adjectives are called な-adjectives.

Note that while some な-adjectives end in い, most such adjectives are written
with kanji rather than hiragana. In general, if you see an adjective ending in
い that uses kanji, it's more likely to be a な-adjective than an い-adjective.
However, just as with many English grammar rules, exceptions to this rule exist.
Notably, several very common adjectives such as きれい and 嫌い are な-adjectives
despite ending in い. And in the case of 嫌い, the adjective uses kanji but
does not conform to the rule mentioned previously.

### い-Adjectives
All い-adjectives end in い; however, not all adjectives that end in い are
い-adjectives. For example, the adjective きれい (pretty) is a な-adjective
despite ending in い.

Conjugating い-adjectives is a bit more complicated than conjugating nouns and
な-adjectives. The following table shows the conjugation rules for い-adjectives;
however, **note that the endings shown in the table take the place of the い at
the end of the adjective**.

|          | Positive | Negative |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Non-Past | い       | くない   |
| Past     | かった   | くなかった |

For example, the adjective 高い (expensive) becomes 高くない in the negative
present tense, 高かった in the positive past tense, and 高くなかった in the
negative past tense.

A major exception for い-adjectives is the adjective いい (good) and the
adjective かっこいい (cool). The conjugation rules for these adjectives are
very different than the rules for other い-adjectives because of historical
reasons. いい was originally よい, and its conjugation rules continue to be
based on よい for forms other than the non-past, positive form. The following
table shows the conjugation rules for いい:

|          | Positive | Negative |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Non-Past | いい      | よくない  |
| Past     | よかった  | よくなかった |

Similarly, かっこいい uses a set of transformations that are based on よい
instead of いい:

|          | Positive | Negative |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Non-Past | かっこいい | かっこよくない |
| Past     | かっこよかった | かっこよくなかった |
